      <p>We currently offer you two contrasting games: “Plantation Lives” (Martin Dusinberre et al) has been at the heart of our development since 2018; it has a play-time of between one and two hours. “Feeling the Past” (Henrik Jochum et al) is a student-authored game and has a play-time of approximately 30 minutes. The trailer, “Defining Work” (Martin Dusinberre et al), was developed for our pre-launch in November 2019, and has a play-time of approximately 20 minutes. For colleagues and students interested in developing their own content for Lives in Transit, we also offer you a “Tutorial” in the form of a game.
