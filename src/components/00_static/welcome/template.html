<h2 class="page-title mb-50">Welcome to Lives in Transit!</h2>
            <p>Lives in Transit is an interactive, text-based game which simulates the experience of researching and writing global history.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>As a player, you will adopt the role of a university graduate student, choose a research topic, and work through a challenging set of storylines. In each topic, you’ll collect real historical sources and create a record of how your thinking changes during research. Your ability to progress will depend on your interactions with a set of fictional characters—in the university, in museums or in the media, and in the archives. Like this historical map of Japan’s Yamashiro province, your research landscape will change as you decide which road you’ll take.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>You can play LiT from your computer (but not yet from mobile devices). After you have logged in with your player name, you can choose either to play individually or to set a topic as a class exercise for your students.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>We hope you learn and have fun. Please give us feedback on Twitter (@transitlives)</p>
