<h2 class="page-title mb-50">Welcome to Lives in Transit!</h2>
            <p>Lives in Transit is a <strong>text-based adventure game</strong> (in the words of one player). Or, to keep things respectably academic, it is an interactive E-learning tool which simulates the experience of researching and writing global history.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a player, you will adopt the role of a university graduate student, choose a research topic, and work through a challenging set of storylines. You’ll collect real historical sources along the way and create a record of how your thinking changes during research. As a teacher, you can set your students to play in class, mapping their progress—and their frustrations—through the different storylines.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Like this historical map of Japan’s Yamashiro province, your research landscape will change as you decide which road you’ll take. So: get lost (as it were). We hope you learn and have fun.</p>
