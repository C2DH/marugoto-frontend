    <h3 class="terms-subheading">1. Object of Data Protection</h3>

    <p>Data protection serves to protect the privacy of individuals. It requires data processors to act lawfully, and confers enforceable rights to the affected persons with regard to the processing of their personal data. Section 3 of the Canton of Zurich’s Act on Information and Data Protection (Gesetz über die Information und den Datenschutz [IDG ZH]) defines personal data as any information related to an identified or identifiable individual. This includes details such as names, addresses, phone numbers, and email or IP addresses.</p>

    <h3 class="terms-subheading">2. Collecting, Processing, and Storing Data</h3>

    <p>In order to play the <i>Lives in Transit</i> game on this website, you will need to create a player profile. For this player profile we need to register the following:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="terms-point">Email address</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In case of using the Universities Federated Login (AAI), the following extra attributes are requested:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="terms-point">Affiliation</li>
        <li class="terms-point">Home organization</li>
    </ul>

    <p>This data is processed in order to identify you in a class. At some point there may be content in the game which we are only allowed to distribute to members of specific organizations/affiliations, which is why these extra attributes are requested from the AAI system. </p>

    <p>All other information that is given in is assumed to be fictional. The fictional information that is requested consists of:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="terms-point">First name</li>
        <li class="terms-point">Last name</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We process this information in order for the game to react to your `character` in the correct context.</p>

    <p>Every time a <i>Lives in Transit</i> web page is requested or called up, the following access data are collected and stored in a web server file on UZH’s servers:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="terms-point">The IP address of the requesting computer (e.g. 123.456.97.36)</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The site or address (URL) from which the web page was requested</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The path and name of the requested web page</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The date and time of the request (e.g. [12/Apr/2016:00:00:01 +0200])</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The volume of data transferred</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The access status</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The type of access</li>
        <li class="terms-point">A description of the type of web browser and/or operating system used</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The session ID</li>
        <li class="terms-point">The serial number of the requesting computer</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These data are processed for the following purposes:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="terms-point">Safeguarding the network infrastructure and facilitating technical administration</li>
        <li class="terms-point">Optimising the use of specific web offerings</li>
        <li class="terms-point">Identifying and tracking unauthorized access attempts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Web server log files are stored for six months after access is terminated. Once this period has elapsed, web server log files are automatically deleted, provided there has been no identified attack on the University’s network infrastructure necessitating the civil or criminal prosecution of the intruder and thus requiring that the log file be stored longer.</p>

    <h3 class="terms-subheading">2a. Data Collection for Research and Teaching</h3>

    <p>While playing the <i>Lives in Transit</i> game, you will progress though a fictional world where you are asked to perform tasks. These tasks will have you enter information in the system. Your journey through the game-world and all related information you add to the system can be used for teaching and research purposes. A summary of information collected and processed this way:</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="terms-point">The pages that you’ve visited while playing the game (your journey) </li>
        <li class="terms-point">All information created in the game (notebook entries and exercises)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>These data will be processed indefinitely, unless you request your account to be deleted. Accounts deleted in this way will not be restored.</p>

    <h3 class="terms-subheading">3. Consent to Further Use of Data</h3>

    <p>Use of specific functions or services on the <i>Lives in Transit</i> website may require further collection, processing, and long-term storage of personal data such as names, addresses, and email addresses. By entering and sending this data, you give your consent for this information to be processed.</p>

    <h3 class="terms-subheading">4. Disclosure of Personal Data</h3>

    <p>Personal data will be disclosed to third parties (e.g. other authorities) only if required by binding legal provisions (e.g. the ruling of an authority, court orders) or for the purposes of legal or criminal prosecution (e.g. in the event of attacks on UZH’s network infrastructure). Personal data will not be disclosed to third parties for other purposes.</p>

    <p>In the future, <i>Lives in Transit</i> may commission third-party service providers to process data collected via the <i>Lives in Transit</i> website for the purposes described above.

    <h3 class="terms-subheading">5. Tracking Settings</h3>

    <p>All your actions within the <i>Lives in Transit</i> game will be tracked. This is necessary for the game to function as intended. For teaching and research purposes it is necessary to know all the paths of all users. It is therefore possible to trace the results of this analysis back to a specific email address and to monitor the behaviour of a data subject.</p>

    <h3 class="terms-subheading">6. Cookies</h3>

    <p>So-called temporary cookies may be used to store session information of the game.

    <h3 class="terms-subheading">8. Use of Social Media Plugins</h3>
