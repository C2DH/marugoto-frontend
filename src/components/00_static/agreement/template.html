    <li>A description of the type of web browser and/or operating system used</li>

    <li>Optimizing the use of specific web offerings</li>
    <li>Identifying and tracking unauthorized access attempts</li>
</ul>

<p>Web server log files are stored for six months after access is terminated. Once this period has elapsed, web server log files are automatically deleted, provided there has been no identified attack on the University’s network infrastructure necessitating the civil or criminal prosecution of the intruder and thus requiring that the log file be stored longer.</p>

<h3>2a. Data Collection for Research and Teaching</h3>

<ul>
    <li>The pages that you’ve visited while playing the game (your journey) </li>
