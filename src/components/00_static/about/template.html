<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Bug bounty program</h3>
<br/>
<p>
To generate ideas, receive feedback, and iron out bugs, we chose to release this beta version of <i>Lives in Transit</i>, with a playable demo topic called <i>Defining Work</i>, in preparation for our major launch in Spring 2020. To further encourage feedback and the reporting of bugs, we've decided to run a <strong><a class="underlined" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program" target="_blank">bug bounty program</a></strong>, which rewards those who inform us of, or fix, some problem with either the game engine or game content.
</p>
<br/>
<p>
So, we're happy to announce that all those who inform us of bugs (via our <a class="underlined" href="https://www.twitter.com/transitlives" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or <a class="underlined" href="https://github.com/uzh/marugoto" target="_blank">GitHub</a>) will be able to see their name, or a name of their choice, appearing in-game within in the first full-version topic, <i>Plantation Lives</i>, to be released in 2020 (<i>Professor Gamey McGameface, anyone?</i>).
</p>
<br/>
<p>
Moreover, those who go so far as to <i>fix</i> a bug (by way of a GitHub pull request) will additionally receive a small gift of appreciation by snail-mail. You'll also be listed as a partner and contributor on the project, which will look great on your CV!
</p>
<br/>
<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Creating your own content</h3>
<br/>
<p>
It's possible to create your own playable topics, simply by writing JSON files that <i>Lives in Transit</i> can import and serve. Help pages for content development are on our roadmap. For now, however, please get in contact if you'd like to create your own content; we'd love to be able to add it to our site so that is playable by any user.
</p>
<br/>
<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Deploying your own <i>Lives in Transit</i></h3>
<br/>
<p>
<i>Lives in Transit</i> is 100 per cent open source and permissively licensed, which means that you can modify and run your own instance of the software, create and add your own topics, and so on. If you're interested in deploying an instance yourself, please be in touch, as full deployment documentation is still in development.
