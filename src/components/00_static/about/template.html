<h2 class="page-title mb-50">About</h2>
<p>
Lives in Transit is run through a custom-built engine called <a class="underlined" href="https://github.com/uzh/marugoto" target="_blank"><i>Marugoto</i></a> (meaning <i>the whole</i> in Japanese).
</p>
<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Bug bounty programme</h3>
<br/>
<p>
Lives in Transit has been a major collaborative effort, including the core team at the University of Zurich (see “Partners” tab) and multiple testers and interlocutors. We hope to continue that work ethic after launch. In particular, to encourage feedback and the reporting of bugs, we've decided to run a Bug Bounty Programme, which rewards those who inform us of, or fix, some problem with either the game engine or game content. All those who inform us of bugs will be named (if they wish) in LiT’s “About” page under a new heading, “Bug Bounty Team”; those who go so far as to fix a bug (by way of a GitHub pull request) will be listed as a contributor to the project.

<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Creating your own content</h3>
<br/>
<p>
One of our aims in the Lives in Transit project has been to make a tool which can be used not just for educational playing purposes, but also to encourage new forms of history writing. One of the game storylines in our 2020 launch, <a class="underlined" href="https://github.com/henokemp/lit-feelingthepast" target="_blank">“Feeling the Past”</a>, is indeed a student-written game, submitted by Henrik Jochum for one of his <a class="underlined" href="https://www.hist.uzh.ch/de/studium/masterstudium/studienprogramme/MA-Zeitgeschichte/MA-History-of-the-Contemporary-World.html" target="_blank">MA History of the Contemporary World/Zeitgeschichte</a> classes at the University of Zurich. We similarly encourage university colleagues and students to consider developing their own content for Lives in Transit, or simply as class assignments. To do so, you can write JSON files that Marugoto can import and serve to Lives in Transit. A first step would be to play the game called “Tutorial”, and also refer to our <a class="underlined" href="https://lives-in-transit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">LiT writers’ guide</a> (under development). Further to that, please be in contact with us by email (globalhistory[at]hist[dot]uzh[dot]ch) if you'd like to create your own content. We’d be delighted to talk with you about how we could work together.

<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Deploying your own <i>Lives in Transit</i></h3>
<br/>
<p>
<i>Lives in Transit</i> is 100 per cent open source and permissively licensed, which means that you can modify and run your own instance of the software, create and add your own topics, and so on. If you're interested in deploying an instance yourself, please be in touch, as full deployment documentation is still in development.
