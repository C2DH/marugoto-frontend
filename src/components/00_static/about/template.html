<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Creating your own content</h3>
<p>
It's possible to create your own playable topics, simply by writing JSON files that Lives in Transit can import and serve.

Help pages for content development are on our roadmap. For now, however, please get in contact if you'd like to create your own content; we'd love to be able to add it to our site so that is playable by any user.

<h3 class="page-title mb-70">Deploying your own Marugoto</h3>
<p>
Lives in Transit is 100 per cent open source and permissively licensed, which means that you can modify and run your own instance of the Marugoto engine, create and add your own topics, and so on. If you're interested in deploying an instance of the game yourself, please be in touch, as full deployment documentation is still in development.
