<h3>Is Lives in Transit a commercial or for-profit project?</h3>

<h3>Where is the line between fact and fiction in Lives in Transit?</h3>
<p>(a) All of the documents (primary and secondary sources) that you see in Lives in Transit are real. So are the archives and public institutions in which you collect those sources. (b) However, your "home" institutions, including your university and local museums, are fictional, as are all the characters that appear in the game. All of the interactions you have in the game are also fictional and the product of the authors' imagination. Thus, in your interactions with fictional characters, any resemblance to actual persons, living or dead, events, or locales is entirely coincidental.</p>

<h3>What is the software behind Lives in Transit?</h3>
<p>The software programme has been custom-built for this project by our external partners, and is completely open source. The programme is called "Marugoto" (meaning "the whole" in Japanese). For information about how you can contribute to Lives in Transit, please see the "About" tab.</p>
